Lately i've been watching past google IO's (or googletalk) video on youtube. Mostly i just want to see how engineer presenting their product or service on a convention. One of the first googletalk i watch is Linus' talk about git, about why he doesn't use the other version control (SVN), it is a very opinionated talk, but still very interesting though. 

Few days ago i'm watching [myth about genius programmer](http://youtube.com), brought by fitzgerald and ben, (both of them are google code programmer) they talk about programmer, psychologically. I encourage you to watch it yourself, but for some preview this is what i get from the talk. 

Firstly, programmers are insecure
Secondly, Technology could change behaviour
Thirdly, well i forgot about it, better watch it again later
