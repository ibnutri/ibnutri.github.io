Oh hi, hello there, world. There're too many reason i've been changing blogging platform, from [wordpress](http://wordpress.com) to [tumblr](http://tumblr.com) no matter what, i think my will to write is just too low. I've never really want to write about anything, especially if my writing should be read by others, yes i hate that obviously (i'm an introvert). But my soon to be wife, let say she enlighten me about writing , she said that i need learn how to write, It'll help me someday (or something like that). So here i am trying to write anything, let the little guy inside my head to swarm the internet.

So why [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)? why not using wordpress or tumblr? Because i like [github](https://github.com), i use [git](http://git-scm.com) rather zealously (some people might think i'm over zealous), i like command line, i like [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), and [Github Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown). That and i'm just bored with php. And github.io domain seems cool. And then i hope i'll keep posting on this blog.

I'll try to post using english in this blog, as hard as possible, probably, dunno. I hope this would be enjoyable, enough to kept me write about stuff, aaaand stuff. That after i could figure out how to make this little monster (homepage file) to behave like list of posts or something like other blogs. 

PS: I spent two hours to setup jekyll, on a VPS (yea right, i couldn't get latest ruby to be installed on my laptop). And i'm gonna destroy the instance, right after this post pushed to github
