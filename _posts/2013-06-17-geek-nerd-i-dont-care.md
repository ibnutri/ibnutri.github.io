## What is This with geek and nerd?

At some point in my [twitter timeline](http://twitter.com/ibnutri) i found someone posting [geek vs nerd infographic](http://www.mastersinit.org/geeks-vs-nerds/). It reminds me of the first time a saw it, i just don't like it. I don't know why, perhaps i just tired seeing peoples trying so hard to earn statuses like "Geeks" or "Nerds" or "Gerds" or "Nerks". I feel like it just waste of time. I've seen TwitWar from two groups of people (that i know of) debating on which one deserve the "Geek" Title.
