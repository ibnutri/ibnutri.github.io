**What is This with geek and nerd?**

At some point in my [twitter timeline](http://twitter.com/ibnutri) i found someone posting [geek vs nerd infographic](http://www.mastersinit.org/geeks-vs-nerds/). It reminds me of the first time i saw it, i just don't like it. I don't know why, perhaps i just tired seeing peoples trying so hard to earn statuses like "Geeks" or "Nerds" or "Gerds" or "Nerks". I feel like it just waste of time. I've seen TwitWar from two groups of people (that i know of) debating on which one deserve the "Geek" Title. 

<!--moar-->

I like coding, i work as a programmer, do i deserve the "geek" title? i don't know, i just like to code. Resolving problem, completing tasks, fixing bugs, things like that? exciting! (i know fixing others bugs are pain in the ass, but you know the excitement when you fixed it).

So guys, why stop at earning the titles? why don't you focused at something more fun than titles? something that would earn you better things than just titles? if you're a coder you could contribute to interesting project on [github](http://github.com). if you're an artist make anything artisty (someone correct me here please). If you're a gamer, play well, perhaps somebody's watching your performance. 

Or perhaps getting the title is the most important to you, just get it then.

I think i just need to let off some steam.
