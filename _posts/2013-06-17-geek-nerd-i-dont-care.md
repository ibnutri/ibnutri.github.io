**What is This with geek and nerd?**

At some point in my [twitter timeline](http://twitter.com/ibnutri) i found someone posting [geek vs nerd infographic](http://www.mastersinit.org/geeks-vs-nerds/). It reminds me of the first time a saw it, i just don't like it. I don't know why, perhaps i just tired seeing peoples trying so hard to earn statuses like "Geeks" or "Nerds" or "Gerds" or "Nerks". I feel like it just waste of time. I've seen TwitWar from two groups of people (that i know of) debating on which one deserve the "Geek" Title. 

I like coding, i work as a programmer, do i deserve the "geek" title? i don't know, i just like to code. Resolving problem, completing tasks, fixing bugs, things like that? exciting (i know fixing others bugs are pain in the ass, but you know how exciting you're when you fixed it).
