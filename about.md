Web developer, Game developer and Maker. Sometimes I talk [rubbish](https://twitter.com/ibnutri). I like PHP (been working with this for years), I like javascript too (also node.js). I like sleep, eating, playing games and board games. Sometimes I do things like origami, papercraft, and wood carving. And now I'm doing things with Microcontrollers.
